  <h2><mat-icon>check_circle_outline</mat-icon> Goals</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Reduce repetitive workflow</strong> when you manually check GitHub
      repositories for the new versions of used libraries
    </li>
    <li>
      Decrease nagging FOMO when you didnâ€™t check Twitter for a whole day and
      fear that you may have <strong>missed a release announcement</strong> by
      the author of the library youâ€™re interested in
    </li>
    <li>
      Empower developers by providing them with a tool that enables them to
      <strong>generate beautifully looking changelogs</strong> which can be used
      in their blog posts, presentations or just shared with others
    </li>
    <li>
      Ability to fill the role of the person who breaks the news to the rest of
      the team is optional ðŸ˜‰
    </li>
  </ol>
