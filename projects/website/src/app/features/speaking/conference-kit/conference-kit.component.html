Tomas is a Fullstack Software Engineer with a weak spot for frontend and
especially Angular. His humble beginnings as a graphic designer can explain his
strong affinity for the frontend even though he doesn't shy from complex
backends be it nodejs or Java. Originally from Kosice Slovakia, Angular JS was
the technology which enabled him to provide value to the developer teams in
Switzerland and eventually travel around the world while working on open source
and blogging about the Angular and other frontend technologies. He strives to
empower teams he is working with by building tools, introducing best practices
and work flows that automate the mundane and enable full focus on creating value
for the end users. While acknowledging that as of 2018, it is possible to
develop robust web applications using any of the available open source
frameworks, he prefers to work with Angular & Typescript because they are the
best fit for large teams and complex realities of big enterprise organizations.
When not working, Tomas enjoys exploring the world, preferably from the back of
a rented scooter in a remote location. Playing old school (90s) computer games
and listening to audiobooks.
